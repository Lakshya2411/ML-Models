# üß† ML From Scratch ‚Äî Practice ML Models Without Scikit-Learn

This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms **from scratch** using **pure Python and NumPy**, focusing solely on **mathematical foundations**‚Äîno machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, or `pytorch` are used.

## üéØ Goal

To deeply understand how ML models work by **building them from the ground up**‚Äîevery algorithm is written based on its mathematical formulation, including:

- Loss functions
- Gradient descent
- Linear algebra
- Calculus
- Probability & statistics

## üìö What You'll Find

| Naive Bayes                        | Supervised   | üöß WIP   | `naive_bayes.py`         |
| K-Means Clustering                 | Unsupervised | üöß WIP   | `kmeans.py`              |
| Principal Component Analysis (PCA) | Unsupervised | üöß WIP   | `pca.py`                 |
| Neural Network (1 hidden layer)    | Supervised   | üöß WIP   | `neural_net.py`          |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All implementations use only `NumPy` and `matplotlib` (for visualization).
